    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intent of Project\n",
    "This project aims to find out the trends and sentiments of the general public on Education Technology (Edtech). Following the increased use of technology in Education, the growth of Edtech industry has been booming. Deemed as the next Fintech, Edtech industry is projected by HolonIQ to grow 2.5 times from 2019 to 2025 (16.7% CAGR) and reaching $404B in total global expenditure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite so, the reception towards the use of technology in education has always been drawing mixed reviews with enthusiasts advocating the positive affordances and the transformative potential of technology on education, while conservatives caution against the inclusion of technology as a distraction to teaching and learning. Hence, this project aims to analyse the broad topics which were discussed in the field of Edtech as well as determine the sentiments of the general public on Edtech. \n",

    "# Approach to Study\n",
    "## Scope and Parameters \n",
    "The year 2020 was chosen as the duration of study as due to the global pandemic, students and teachers of numerous countries were forced to engage in remote learning due to school closure as part of the preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Twitter was chosen as the platform for analysis as:\n",
    "1. it is a common social media platform for users to share their opinions\n",
    "2. format of tweets predominantly in text and is suitable for text analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "With these considerations in mind, the top tweets (determined based on Twitter's Algorithm) tagged with \"#edtech\" and \"#education and #technology\" from 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31 were mined with the Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of Library - Twint\n",
    "In order to mine tweets, Twitter API was first explored. Using R, TwitteR and Rtweets packages were used and tweets were successfully collated into CSV files. However, one of the key limitation of using Twitter's API was the access restrictions of tweets (which only allowed access of tweets which are up to 7 days old). This results in severe limitations in trend spotting and meaning making since the results from the analysis of a week's data would hardly be representative of the broader trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, alternative approaches to mine tweets were sourced. Due to the frequent updates from Twitter and the need to adhere to the updated policies, many explored packages were no longer in function. The library used in this project is Twint and it was able to perform the required task of tweet mining for the year of 2020. The following resources were consulted and followed in this project:\n",
    "1. https://github.com/twintproject/twint\n",
    "2. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-with-python-twint-83b4c70c5536\n",
    "3. https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/analyzing-tweets-nlp-spark-optimus-twint.html\n",
